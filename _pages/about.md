My name is Bavand Sadeghi, and I am an atmospheric scientist specializing in transport modeling and pollutant dispersion analysis. I work at NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory (ARL), where I focus on the development and evaluation of advanced modeling systems for atmospheric emissions, using real-world tracer analysis and observations to improve transport and dispersion predictions. You can learn more about my background [Here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L1JHS48AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1).
